# Solver Benchmarks

Benchmarking `MixedComplementarityProblems` solver(s) against PATH.

## Instructions

This directory provides code to benchmark the `InteriorPoint` solver against `PATH`, accessed via `ParametricMCPs` and `PATHSolver`. Currently, we provide two different benchmark problems: (i) a set of randomly-generated sparse quadratic programs with user-specified numbers of primal variables and inequality constraints, and (ii) the lane changing trajectory game from `examples/`, with initial conditions randomized. To run (with the REPL activated within this directory):

```julia
julia> include("SolverBenchmarks.jl")
julia> data = SolverBenchmarks.benchmark(SolverBenchmarks.TrajectoryGameBenchmark(); num_samples = 25)
julia> SolverBenchmarks.summary_statistics(data)
```

If you want to re-run with different kwargs, you may be able to reuse the MCPs and avoid waiting for them to compile:

```julia
julia> data = SolverBenchmarks.benchmark(SolverBenchmarks.TrajectoryGameBenchmark(); num_samples = 250, data.ip_mcp, data.path_mcp)
julia> SolverBenchmarks.summary_statistics(data)
```
